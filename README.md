# Conway's Game of Life

This is a personal project to try and implement [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) in Python, so that I can learn a bit more about the language. I got the idea from a website and will try to work out how to improve the algorithm to calculate subsequent states.
